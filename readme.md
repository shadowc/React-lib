## React Lib

### A set of React Components wrapped in classes for ease of use

Usage:

Include any of the files under `dist` in your browser page and instantiate the classes normally by:

`let myGrid = new ReactLib.Grid({...})`

`myGrid.render(document.getElementById('grid'))`

or if you prefer a **ReactJs** approach:

`<ReactGrid ...myProps />`
